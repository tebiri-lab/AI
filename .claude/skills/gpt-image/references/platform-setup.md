# Cross-platform setup

Read this reference only when Node.js, Git, Codex CLI, PATH, or OS compatibility is missing or uncertain.

## Supported environments

| Environment | Node and repository | Codex installer | Important boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | macOS user environment | `https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh` | Apple Silicon and Intel are both valid; inspect `uname -m`. |
| Native Linux | Linux user environment | `https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh` | Use a supported distribution and a user-owned persistent clone. |
| Native Windows | PowerShell and Windows paths | `https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1` | Keep Node, Codex, clone, and skill links on the Windows side. |
| WSL2 | WSL Linux home and Linux paths | `https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh` | Install everything inside WSL2 and prefer `~/...`, not `/mnt/c/...`. |
| WSL1 | Not supported | Do not install for this route | Current Codex no longer supports WSL1; migrate to WSL2 or use native Windows. |

Do not mix a Windows `node.exe` with a WSL clone, or a WSL Codex binary with a native Windows Claude Code or Antigravity session. The calling agent, Node runtime, Codex CLI, skill links, workspace, and generated output must belong to the same environment.

## Stage 0: inspect before changing the machine

On macOS, Linux, or WSL:

```bash
uname -s
uname -m
printf 'WSL=%s\n' "${WSL_DISTRO_NAME:-no}"
node --version
git --version
command -v codex || true
```

On native Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.VersionString
$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
Get-Command node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Command git -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Get-Command codex -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Report what is missing. Node, Git, Codex, WSL, or package-manager installation changes the user environment, so require authorization before installing it. The README's recommended copy-paste installer prompt grants user-level authorization for these exact dependencies; it does not grant administrator elevation. Never request elevated privileges until the chosen installer actually needs them.

## Stage 1: install Node.js when missing

This skill requires Node.js 22 or newer and recommends the latest supported LTS from <https://nodejs.org/en/download>. Node.js 18 and 20 are end-of-life and must not be treated as ready.

### macOS

If Homebrew is already present, a simple maintained path is:

```bash
brew install node
```

Otherwise use the signed macOS installer from the official Node.js download page. Do not install Homebrew solely as an unannounced side effect of installing this skill.

### Native Linux and WSL2

If an existing Node version manager is present, install its latest LTS, for example:

```bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

Otherwise use the official Node.js download/package-manager instructions for the distribution. A distribution package is acceptable only when `node --version` is 22 or newer; do not accept an old repository version merely because installation exited successfully.

### Native Windows

With Windows Package Manager available:

```powershell
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

Otherwise use the LTS `.msi` from the official Node.js download page. Close and reopen PowerShell after installation so `PATH` refreshes.

### Verify Node

```text
node --version
```

Require major version 22 or newer. Then run the skill's `doctor --json`; its runtime check is authoritative for this repository.

## Stage 2: install Git only when URL cloning needs it

- macOS: use an existing Homebrew (`brew install git`) or the system's developer-tools prompt.
- Debian/Ubuntu/WSL2: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git` after approval.
- Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install git` after approval.
- Native Windows: `winget install -e --id Git.Git` after approval.

Open a new shell if the command is still missing. Clone this repository into a persistent user directory; do not install from a temporary checkout because host links point back to the clone.

## Stage 3: bootstrap this skill

From the persistent repository clone:

```text
node gpt-image/scripts/validate_skill.mjs
node gpt-image/scripts/gpt_image.mjs bootstrap --target all --yes --json
```

On macOS, Linux, and WSL2 this creates symlinks. On native Windows it creates directory junctions. The installer refuses to replace an unrelated existing path.

Windows host paths resolve under `%USERPROFILE%`:

```powershell
Get-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\gpt-image"
Get-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\gpt-image"
Get-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\config\skills\gpt-image"
```

The third path is Google Antigravity's documented global skill directory. Antigravity loads the skill instructions there, but image generation still runs through the ChatGPT-authenticated Codex CLI bridge. Do not replace that route with Antigravity's built-in `generate_image` tool.

## Stage 4: install Codex CLI when missing

Optionally verify both current official installers without executing them:

```text
node gpt-image/scripts/gpt_image.mjs verify-installers --json
```

This follows HTTPS redirects only to `chatgpt.com` or `releases.openai.com` and returns SHA-256 receipts.

After the user approves the external installation:

```text
node gpt-image/scripts/gpt_image.mjs install-codex --yes
```

The runner downloads the exact official installer into an OS temporary directory, checks that the response is a script rather than HTML, executes it, and removes the temporary file. It uses the shell installer on macOS/Linux/WSL2 and the PowerShell installer on Windows.

If the runner cannot be used, the official commands are:

macOS/Linux/WSL2:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Native Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Prefer the repository runner when possible because it avoids piping a remote response directly into a shell and gives the workflow one audited installer URL.

## Stage 5: sign in with ChatGPT

```text
node gpt-image/scripts/gpt_image.mjs login
```

The user completes browser/device authorization. Do not type credentials for them, read `auth.json`, or accept API-key login. Then run:

```text
node gpt-image/scripts/gpt_image.mjs doctor --json
```

Do not generate until `ready=true` and `chatgpt_subscription_login=true`.

## PATH and host refresh

If an installer succeeds but `doctor` still cannot find a command:

1. Close and reopen the terminal or agent host.
2. Run `node --version`, `git --version`, and `codex --version` in that same terminal.
3. On WSL2, confirm the paths are Linux paths and `echo $WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is non-empty.
4. Restart Codex, Claude Code, or Google Antigravity after first skill installation if its skill list is stale.
5. Do not work around PATH failure by invoking an API endpoint.

## Setup completion checks

The bridge is ready only when `doctor --json` reports:

```json
{
  "platform_supported": true,
  "node_supported": true,
  "codex_available": true,
  "chatgpt_subscription_login": true,
  "api_environment_forwarded": false,
  "codex_skill_installed": true,
  "claude_skill_installed": true,
  "antigravity_skill_installed": true,
  "best_practice_pass": true
}
```

After setup, generate directly. Planning and the no-image setup check (`generate --dry-run`) are optional troubleshooting tools, not first-use gates. In user-facing messages, call the latter “a setup check that does not create an image.” A normal result needs only a workspace-contained usable PNG, its absolute path, and an inline preview. SHA-256 remains relevant to verifying a downloaded installer, not to ordinary generated images.

Setup readiness verifies the local bridge and ChatGPT sign-in; it does not probe plan entitlement by spending an image generation. The CLI bridge leaves the changing model catalog unpinned and requests Low reasoning from a current account-available Codex model; it also invokes the built-in image renderer without pinning an underlying renderer model. Plan eligibility follows the current Codex service and official pricing, and the skill must not offer an API bypass.
